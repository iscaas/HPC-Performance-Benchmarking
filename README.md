# Liquid-Cooled Vs Air-Cooled NVIDIA Nodes Performance Benchmarking 
This repository provides code, benchmarking scripts, and performance analysis for comparing liquid-cooled and air-cooled NVIDIA HPC (High-Performance Computing) nodes using compute-intensive AI/ML (i.e., LLMs and VLMs) workloads. The goal is to assess the thermal and computational efficiency, power consumption, and throughput of both cooling systems under identical workloads.
